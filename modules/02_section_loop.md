# Module 02 – Section Loop

**Purpose:** Summarize each section of the paper under the PS2 constraints.

**Responsibilities:**
- Loop over each section in the normalized section list.
- For each section, generate a summary that:
  - Respects the 120-word maximum limit.
  - Preserves key terminology consistently across sections.
  - Avoids hallucinations and does not invent results or citations.
- Adjust style based on audience:
  - **Expert** → use more technical language and precise terms.
  - **General** → use simpler language and focus on main ideas.
- Store each section summary so it can be reused by later modules (tables, overall summary, glossary).

**Passes to:** Module 03 – Guardrails.
