# Module 04 – Rendering & Refinement

**Purpose:** Build all final user-facing outputs in a consistent structure.

**Responsibilities:**
- Combine the individual section summaries into a coherent **Paper Summary** that follows the original section order.
- Create a **Section-by-Section Table** showing each section and its short summary.
- Generate:
  - An **Expert Summary** for readers with background in the field.
  - A **Lay Summary** for a general audience with simpler wording.
- Build a **Mini-Glossary** of important technical terms that appear in the paper.
- Collect all warning messages from earlier modules and output them under **Checks & Warnings**.
- Apply any user-requested edits only to the affected parts without breaking the structure.

**Passes to:** Module 05 – Citation & Reference Extractor and Module 06 – Key Contributions & Limitations (for integration).
